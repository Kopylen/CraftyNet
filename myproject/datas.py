You can also use tilde (~) or caret (^) notation with a number to express relative coordinates offset from your current position, with the notation by itself representing ~0 or ^0 means no offset. Tilde offsets are based on the world coordinates, so ~5 ~ ~-5 would be +5 blocks on x (east), 0 blocks on y (same height), and -5 blocks on z (north). Caret offsets are based on the direction the player is head is facing along left, upward, and forward axes, so ^5 ^ ^-5 would be 5 blocks left, 0 blocks upward (same height), and 5 blocks backward. \n Here is an overview of Minecraft commands used to alter the world and environment: '},
